I am a third-year master student at Zhejiang University, and I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Zhongjie Ba](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dO2kc6kAAAAJ) and [Kui Ren](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uuQA_rcAAAAJ). Prior to attending ZJU, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Zhejiang University City College (Hangzhou City University).

My current research interests are focused on exploring LLM and Large Multimodal Models self-alignment and building Large Multimodal Models for embodied AI.



[//]: # (My particular interest lies in designing for sequential decision-making, utilizing unified approaches to learn from diverse and/or unlabeled sequential data, and boarder logistic and applications with large foundation models.)

  + **Applied Research on Visual Large Language Models** <br>
        exploring LLM and Large Multimodal Models self-alignment and building Large Multimodal Models for embodied AI.

- **Remote Research Intern:**  Microsoft Research. Supervised by Dr. [Shuang Ma](https://www.shuangma.me/). May 2022 - March 2023 <br>
  + **Pretraining model for perception and control** <br>
    proposed a "Dual-phase" training approach that mimics human learning, merging self-supervised knowledge acquisition with decision-making based on context,demonstrating exceptional generalizability across tasks without task-specific fine-tuning.

  + **Speech privacy eavesdropping protection**<br>
    design a phoneme-based noise that is robust against denoising methods and can effectively prevent both humans and machines from understanding the jammed signals.
  + **Deepfake detection**<br>
    introduced an incremental learning framework for deepfake detection, leveraging domain-invariant representation and multi-perspective knowledge distillation.
